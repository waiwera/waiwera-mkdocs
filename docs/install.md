# Installation

Waiwera can be run on most operating systems (e.g. Linux, Windows, Mac
OS) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). For many users this will
be the easiest option. Linux users also have the option of building a
native Waiwera executable.

## Using Docker

## Native Linux build

<!-- Building a native Waiwera executable is currently only possible on -->
<!-- Linux. The reason is that Waiwera uses the -->
<!-- [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) library, which is not easy to -->
<!-- build on other platforms. -->
