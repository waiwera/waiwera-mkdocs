# Contributing to Waiwera

Because Waiwera is released under a free, open-source
[license](license.md), you may contribute code.

Waiwera's source code is written in Fortran 2003, so you will need to
be familiar with that in order to contribute. You will also need to
know how to use the [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control
system.

## Pull requests

You can contribute code to Waiwera by submitting a "[pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)". To
do this, first you need to
[fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
the Waiwera repository and check it out onto your local machine. You
can commit your changes locally and then push them back up to your
fork on Github. Finally, you can make a [pull
request](https://github.com/waiwera/waiwera/pulls) on the Waiwera repository.

Your proposed changes will then be reviewed, discussed and altered as
necessary. If it is agreed that your changes are appropriate then they
will be merged into the Waiwera code.

## Unit tests

Waiwera uses a test-driven development cycle, so in general any new
code should be accompanied by unit tests to make sure it works
correctly. Waiwera uses the [Zofu](https://github.com/acroucher/zofu)
library for creating unit tests.

## Reporting issues

You can also help improve Waiwera by reporting any [issues](issues.md).
