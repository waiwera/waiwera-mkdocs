To do this, first you need to fork the Waiwera repository and check it out onto your local machine. You can commit your changes locally and then push them back up to your fork on Github. Finally, you can make a pull request on the Waiwera repository.</p> <p>Your proposed changes will then be reviewed, discussed and altered as necessary. If it is agreed that your changes are appropriate then they will be merged into the Waiwera code.</p>"},{"location":"contrib/#unit-tests","title":"Unit tests","text":"<p>Waiwera uses a test-driven development cycle, so in general any new code should be accompanied by unit tests to make sure it works correctly.
